## The Game
In a world long gone dark, Lux must harness the light of fireflies to purify the lost souls roaming Earth.

Violent lost souls roam an Earth long gone dim. Armed only with fireflies, a former household robot Lux will put itself in harm’s way to vanquish the world’s darkness. Lux must purify the souls by provoking and luring them into the fireflies’ light, all while avoiding destruction by the very souls it is trying to save.
